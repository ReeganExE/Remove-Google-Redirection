Remove-Google-Redirection
=========================

Remove redirection and click-tracking in Google search results.

For google chrome users, you can install the extension "[Remove Google Redirection](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-google-redirection/dnhjklgpiifbofihffldllbcopkinlod)" instead, it's the same as the user scripts, but the advantage is extension can sync between your chromes on different computer.

Support: Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome
